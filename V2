Cutlery Business ERP System Proposal

Executive Summary

This proposal presents a custom .NET-based ERP system for a cutlery business sourcing raw materials from China, manufacturing in Pakistan, and selling to B2B customers in the US market. The system integrates procurement, manufacturing, warehouse management, financials, sales, and a specialized costing module, providing real-time visibility across multiple currencies and countries. Priced at $10,500 for the first year (with $3,000/year maintenance), it undercuts Odoo’s $26,080-$46,480 first-year cost, offering free QA, installation, integration, 3-month support, and 4 months of free server space for 20 users. Built with .NET Core, Angular/Blazor, and SQL Server Express, the solution ensures full ownership, scalability, and long-term savings.
